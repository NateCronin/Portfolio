# Nathan Cronin - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About Me 

Hello, I'm Nathan! This portfolio is intended to show my growing knowledge and skillset as it relates to data analysis and data science. I've always had a strong passion for analytics, and upon receving my degree in Health Administration I decided to pursue this passion further. Over the past year I have made countless strides in strenghting my abilites as a detail-oriented thinker and working with data tools. I have gained vital experience working with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and others. My future goals are to, hopefully, land a position working with data on a day-to-day basis, and to eventually enter a Master's program with a focus on Data Science. 

Below, you will be able to find some projects I have worked on in the past as well as some other skills and certificates I have obtained. My intention is to continuosuly update this portfolio, so I hope you'll be able to follow my journey!

### **Yelp Reviews Analysis**

[*`SQL Code`*](Projects/YelpCode.sql)

[*Project Proposal*](Projects/ProjectProposal.pdf)

**Description:** This Project's focus was to analyze a datset of Yelp reviews of various businesses from 2005 to 2022. The goal was to help a fictional start-up coffee company in providing insights for location, market demographics, and other various business advice. This dataset included 5 distinct tables with information on businesses, reviews, Yelp users, tips users could leave, and times users checked into the business. In order to accompolish the intended goals, the data was loaded into Google Cloud, cleaned & processed using Google BigQuery, and thustly analyzed. Exploratory Data Analysis and correlation analysis were performed as well as creating a predictive model based on text sentiment analysis on keywords left on reviews. All visualizations were created using Tableau.

**Skills:** Data Analysis, ETL, Data Modeling, Data Cleaning, Relational Database Mgmt, Cloud Storage

**Technology:** Google Cloud, SQL (Google Big Query), Microsoft Excel, Tableau
